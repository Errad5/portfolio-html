<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>Amazing character and world building.</p>
<h4>And here is a poem about One Piece.</h4>
<p>Ahoy! Smiling Nakama<br />
Known as Mugiwara, hat made of straw<br />
Tons of fun, Luffy brings a great guffaw<br />
A form of escapism, life no more sour<br />
Mesmeric toothy flash, pearly whites<br />
Slit-eyed, cheeks rise likes tides<br />
Makes my lips curved into a crescent<br />
An epidemic cause by such contagious smile<br />
Watching him sailing makes it worth a while<br />
Temporarily mute the ambient negative vibes<br />
On-board in the quest of the infamous pirate treasure<br />
Utterly soaked up in the vivid scenery is a real pleasure</p>
